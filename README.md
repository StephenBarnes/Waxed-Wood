Minecraft mod adding waxed wood.

Run the file `make_waxedwood_resource_files.py` to generate all textures,
recipes, etc. You can give the location of the vanilla resource pack as first
arg to re-generate the textures.

The resource script references two scripts, `colors/curves` and `colors/colorbalance`, to
generate textures. You will need to download these from
